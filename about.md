Hi !, <br/>
    I am Keshava. I work as Embedded Systems Software Developer at [Infinera Corporation](http://infinera.com). 
    I work on Software development for Optical Networking Equipment. I have a keen interest in Machine Learning (Deep Learning in particular), Coding Theory and Distributed & Randomized Algorithms. <br/>
    I am currently doing some independent research in Deep Learning, mostly in the areas of Multi Lable Classification, RNNs and Attention based mechanisms. I will try to post my projects and findings (if any :) ) here.
